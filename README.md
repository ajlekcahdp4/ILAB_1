## 2.[**Onegin**](https://github.com/ajlekcahdp4/ILAB_1/tree/main/Onegin)
This program works with the poem "Evgeniy Onegin" in my case, but can do these things whith any other text files.
The program, that sort whole text of the poem by the beginning of the lines (and then by line ends) in alphabetical order.
Then the program generates its own poem from the lines of "Evreniy Onegin" which is very funny to read )0)

* "Evgeniy Onegin" is a very important and famous poem of Russian writer A.S.Pushkin.
